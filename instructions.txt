How to run the Program:

1. Make sure you have installed Python 2.7 and music21 (http://web.mit.edu/music21/)
2. Run driver.py.  This will generate a song for "Autumn Leaves."  The first part of the generated
song will be the original, and the second half is the generated solo.
3. melody.py is the code for generating the solo based on the original song melody,
while harmony.py is the code for generating solo music based only on the chords.
4. The generated song will use melody.py first in its generated solo, and
harmony.py in the second half.  So melody.py is used halfway through the song,
and harmony.py is used 3/4 of the way.
